//! The GPU canvas: the trait an app's surfaces implement and the module
//! that runs them on a wgpu device (LLP 1009).
//!
//! **wgpu is the one GPU API, on every host** (D1): a surface is written
//! against wgpu's own types and runs on Metal, Vulkan, or the browser's
//! WebGPU unchanged. **The module is loaded on demand** (D2): an app's GPU
//! crate compiles its surfaces and this crate into one artifact — a
//! `dylib` natively, a wasm with wasm-bindgen glue on the web — that the
//! presenter loads the first time a canvas is on screen, after the first
//! pixel. Inputs cross as JSON-encoded plan values; wgpu objects never
//! cross. Failures are per canvas, reported by [`Module::take_error`], never a
//! refusal of anything else.
//!
//! - [`Surface`], [`Frame`] — what an app implements.
//! - [`Module`] — the device and the instances, one per canvas node.
//! - [`json`] — the values as the batch carries them.
//! - [`shaders`] — the WGSL by name, registered at run time (LLP 1030 D8).
//! - [`module!`] — the exports for one app's registry.
//! - `fixture` (native) — a surface rendered and read back, for fixtures.
