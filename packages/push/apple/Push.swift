// @exact/push on iOS and iPadOS (LLP 1133.004 §9 P3, P4): the APNs device
// token as a live value, for the app to send to its own server; Exact sends
// and relays nothing.
//
// - `subscribePush()` is the one call that may prompt, and only while
//   `notDetermined`: notification permission is asked then (with the options
//   a post asks for), refused `NotAllowedError` while denied, and every
//   authorization `pushPermissionState()` reads as granted (authorized,
//   provisional, ephemeral) registers without asking; then the token the
//   process already holds, or the system's answer to a registration: the
//   token, or `AbortError` with the system's message.
// - `pushSubscription()` never prompts. While permission is granted it reads
//   the token, registering once a launch, as Apple asks of every launch
//   ("Registering your app with APNs"); otherwise it reads null and registers
//   nothing. A change of permission (Settings, then back to the app) is
//   announced to its readers, who read again.
// - The system answers on the app delegate. When the package loads it asks
//   the host to give the delegate the two answering methods, which the host
//   adds where the delegate does not answer them already (an embedder's own
//   forwards to the host itself); so an app that does not import it has
//   neither. Either way the answer reaches the host, which keeps it
//   (`context.push`) and posts each one.
