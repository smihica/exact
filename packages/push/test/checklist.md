# Push through APNs, on a simulator and a device (LLP 1133.004 §9 P9)

What the drive (`drive.mjs`) cannot do: send through Apple's push service,
which needs the team's APNs auth key, and sign against a profile with Push
Notifications. A person with the key runs these. Each step names what to see;
a step that shows something else is a finding. The docs claim the APNs path
and the device only after the step that shows it has passed.

## What the account must have first

- An APNs auth key for the team (Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles ›
  Keys, with Apple Push Notifications service): the `.p8` file, its key id,
  and the team id.
- For the device steps, the App ID of the app being run registered with Push
  Notifications, and a development profile for it that includes the phone;
  then an Ad Hoc profile for it.

## Sending one push

`TOKEN` is the device token the app shows (the fixture's `token` row, or the
journal); `TOPIC` is the app's bundle id; `HOST` is
`api.sandbox.push.apple.com` for a simulator and a development build,
`api.push.apple.com` for an Ad Hoc, TestFlight or App Store build.

```sh
KEY=AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX TEAM_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
JWT=$(KEY=$KEY KEY_ID=$KEY_ID TEAM_ID=$TEAM_ID bun -e '
  const pem = await Bun.file(process.env.KEY).text();
  const der = Buffer.from(pem.replace(/-----[^-]+-----|\s/g, ""), "base64");
  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey("pkcs8", der, { name: "ECDSA", namedCurve: "P-256" }, false, ["sign"]);
  const b64 = (x) => Buffer.from(typeof x === "string" ? x : new Uint8Array(x)).toString("base64url");
  const head = b64(JSON.stringify({ alg: "ES256", kid: process.env.KEY_ID }));
  const claims = b64(JSON.stringify({ iss: process.env.TEAM_ID, iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) }));
  const sig = await crypto.subtle.sign({ name: "ECDSA", hash: "SHA-256" }, key, Buffer.from(`${head}.${claims}`));
  console.log(`${head}.${claims}.${b64(sig)}`);')
curl -v --http2 "https://$HOST/3/device/$TOKEN" \
  -H "authorization: bearer $JWT" -H "apns-topic: $TOPIC" -H "apns-push-type: alert" \
  -d '{"aps":{"alert":{"title":"Delayed","body":"The 9:41 now leaves at 9:52"},"sound":"default"},"navigate":"/thread/42"}'
```

APNs answers `HTTP/2 200` with an `apns-id` header. `400 BadDeviceToken`
means the token belongs to the other environment (the other `HOST`).

## Simulator (an Apple silicon Mac)

1. `bun packages/push/test/drive.mjs --bound --sim <udid> --keep`: the drive
   prints the token's length and keeps the app. Read the token with
   `bun exact.mjs agent ios --bind push tree` in the kept app (the `token`
   row). Measured 2026-11-11 on an iPhone 17 Pro simulator, iOS 27.0: the
   simulator answered a token (80 bytes).
2. Send the push above to `api.sandbox.push.apple.com` with that token and the
   kept app's bundle id, the app in the background: the banner shows.
3. Tap it: the app opens `/thread/42` (the `got` row reads `/thread/42`).
4. Send it again with the app in front: the banner shows over the app; tap it,
   the same.

## iPhone

5. In an app that grants `device.notifications` and `device.push` and imports
   `@exact/push` (the fixture, made as `drive.mjs` makes it, with its bundle
   id registered as above): `bun exact.mjs ios --device --run`. The build signs
   `aps-environment` `development`; a profile without Push Notifications is
   refused before building, naming it.
6. Turn on push: the system's prompt; Allow; the token row shows a token
   (32 bytes on a phone, so 64 hex digits).
7. Send to `api.sandbox.push.apple.com`: the banner, on the Lock Screen too;
   tap it, `/thread/42`. Quit the app and tap another: the app launches at
   `/thread/42`.
8. Quit and reopen without pressing anything: the token row shows the same
   token (the relaunch only reads `pushSubscription()`).
9. Archive with the Ad Hoc profile (`--archive`), install it, turn on push:
   the token differs from step 6's; send to `api.push.apple.com`: the banner,
   and its tap opens the route.
10. In an app that also has a Live Activity taking pushes, the archive of step
    9 builds (registration beside the activity, under `device.push`), and the
    activity's update token and the device token both arrive.
