//! A node's `:hover` and `:focus-visible` looks on the page (LLP 1121 D8,
//! stage 8 B), as one rule a state in the page's looks sheet, composed in
//! that order over the node's inline base, so rows a look doesn't name show
//! the base. They show at once (no transition: a look's colours snap, under
//! Reduce Motion too), and under the shell's pressed paint, which `:active`
//! lowers to (LLP 1061 D7, the input glue's important rule per painting node).
