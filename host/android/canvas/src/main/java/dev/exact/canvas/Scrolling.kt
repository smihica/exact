/**
 * A finger scrolls (LLP 1115.001 D7.1 to D7.3). The gesture and its physics are the reader's, with the platform's own
 * classes and nothing imitated: the system's touch slop and fling velocities ([ViewConfiguration]), [VelocityTracker],
 * [OverScroller] for the fling, the stretch [EdgeEffect] at the ends, and the scrollbar a [View] draws and fades.
 *
 * The reader moves a scroller at once and exact2 catches up: a scroller whose rows the stream keeps in a node of their
 * own (a group) is translated here, on the UI thread, in the frame the finger moved; exact2 is told how far
 * ([Native.scrolled]) and fills in rows behind it. A scroller with no such node (one inside another's row, one that
 * scrolls sideways, the page itself) moves when exact2's paint of it arrives, which the frame waits a moment for.
 *
 * What crosses to exact2 and back is `host/painted/src/presenter/scrollers.rs`:
 * - at a touch's down the reader asks what is under it ([Native.under]): the scrollers, innermost first, and the axes
 *   exact2's own gestures claim there (a swipe row, a reorder grip, a `pan`);
 * - past the slop, a drag along an axis exact2 claims stays its own; along one a scroller under the finger scrolls
 *   on, the scroll wins: exact2's press and drag recognition for the touch is cancelled ([ExactView.forward] with a
 *   cancel) and no more of the touch reaches it;
 * - a move goes to the innermost scroller first and what it cannot take (it is at its end) to the next one out, as
 *   nested scrolling hands off on Android; what none can take stretches the innermost one's edge;
 * - with each stream exact2 says where the scrollers the reader knows are, where their rows were painted and how far
 *   they go ([Native.scrollers]), with a revision that moves on when the app scrolled one itself: the reader then
 *   takes exact2's offset and ends the fling that was moving it. A scroller that statement leaves out is gone.
