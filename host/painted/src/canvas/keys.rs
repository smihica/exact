//! Keys and system Back for the Canvas host's reader (Android). The
//! reader's view takes the window's key events (a hardware keyboard's, the
//! IME's committed text sent as keys, a driver's injected ones) and hands
//! them here; they go where the display's keyboard goes on Linux
//! ([`Presenter::key`]): the focused node, as a keydown and then its default
//! action (a character typed into a field, Backspace, Enter).
//!
//! While an editable field holds the focus the reader shows the platform's
//! software keyboard: the presenter tells it so, as a request
//! (`requests.rs`, LLP 1115.001 D5). System Back goes where the presenter's order sends it
//! (LLP 1115.001 D6, [`crate::presenter::Presenter::system_back`]): the
//! navigation root's authored Back control, else its `navigate`, else the
//! runner's own `back`. The reader takes Back only while the presenter says
//! it has somewhere to go, so at the first screen the system's own Back
//! leaves the app; a Back that arrives and is not taken finishes the
//! activity, as it did.
