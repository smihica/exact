//! The routes a touch shell's presenter places itself (`presenter/stage.rs`):
//! a sheet over its scrim, and two routes crossing in a push or a pop. The
//! presenter hands the painter a short display list each frame; the walk
//! leaves the routes it names to it and draws it after the last route of
//! the stack, so what the app wrote after the routes (a toast) stays above.
//!
//! A live route is drawn by the ordinary walk with its border box at the
//! origin of the item's transform, so its boxes are hit where they show. A
//! route the presenter keeps a drawing of is also recorded into a tape
//! (`tape.rs`) in that same space: the commit that removes it leaves the
//! tape, which the presenter slides out.
