//! What a shell answers its platform's accessibility services with (LLP
//! 1115.001 D13). Android's reader has one view, and what is in it is
//! painted, so TalkBack sees nothing unless the reader's view answers for
//! it: an `AccessibilityNodeProvider` whose virtual nodes are these
//! (`host/android/canvas`, `Access.kt`). Desktop Linux has no shell that
//! asks (LLP 1015 §7: no AT-SPI tree), and nothing here runs there.
//!
//! **Nothing is built until the shell asks.** The tree is made in
//! [`Presenter::reader_access`], which the reader calls only while an
//! accessibility service is on. It is made again only when a commit, a
//! paint, a scroll, a bar or the top layer moved on since the last one, and
//! told only when it differs from what was last told.
//!
//! **What a node is.** From the kernel's tree, as the Apple hosts read it
//! (`Accessibility.swift`): a pressable is one element named by its label,
//! else its words (those of a control inside it are that control's); a
//! control is its platform kind with its state; a text outside any of them
//! is itself, a heading where its role says so; an image is one only where
//! it is named; a scroll container that scrolls holds what is in it; a
//! `tablist` holds its tabs; a table holds its caption and rows, a row its
//! cells, and a description list its terms and descriptions; a live region
//! is kept so that its change is spoken. Everything else is no node, and
//! its children stand under the node above. What is hidden, inert,
//! `aria-hidden`, under a route that
//! does not show, or out of what its scrollers show is left out.
//!
//! **Where the bars and the top layer are.** A header the top app bar
//! replaced and the root `tablist` the navigation bar replaced are not in
//! the page (`bars.rs`): their nodes are read from the bars, first and
//! last, so the order is bar, content, navigation bar. While a surface of
//! the top layer is open (`top.rs`) the tree is that surface alone, in its
//! own window's space: the page under it cannot be reached. While a
//! select's menu is open the tree is that select and the menu's listbox
//! (`access/menu.rs`).
//!
//! **Identity** ([`identity`]) is what a platform keeps its place by, so it
//! must outlive a commit, a scroll, and a row that leaves and returns. A
//! node's is its view id, which the runner keeps while the view lives.
//! Under a list's row it is derived from the list's own identity, the
//! row's item key and the node's place in the row, since a row's views are
//! given to another item when it scrolls away (LLP 1078).
//!
//! **A hosted text field** is the reader's own view (D8) and reports
//! itself: its node here says only where it stands in the order and what
//! its author named it.
