// The author's pressed paint (LLP 1061 D7), on both platforms: while the
// press `pressed` tracks holds a node (the bit `-exact-press-scale` and the
// platform's dim use), it shows its `-exact-press-opacity` as a fraction of
// its own opacity, its active `background-color` in place of its
// background, and its active `color` as its text colour, which its
// subtree takes as CSS's `color` is taken (a descendant with a colour of its
// own keeps it). Eased in and back on the scale's curve and duration, at once
// under the agent's clock; a release before the press was ever on screen
// waits until it has eased in, as the scale's does. No runner round trip.
//
// The opacity is an additive Core Animation on `opacity`, as the platform's
// dim is (PressFeedback.swift), so it composes with every engine write. The
// colours stand in the views' styles for the keys they replace, the engine's
// values kept beside them (`pressPainted`, which an engine write passes
// through), and the change cross-fades.
//
// A node's `:active` (LLP 1121 D8) lowers to these rows, its opacity to
// `press_opacity_to`: an absolute target the press eases to from what shows
// (a hover look's included), not a share. Its `:hover` and `:focus-visible`
// looks stand in under the press while the pointer hovers it (the Mac, an
// iPad's pointer) or its focus is visible, at once, their opacity an additive
// layer opacity (`looked`). A look's `color` is its text colour and its
// subtree's, lent below as the press's colour is (`inkLooks`), under the
// press's own.
