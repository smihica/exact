# A select's menu on the painted hosts reaches no assistive technology, and is no platform popup on Android or Windows

**Status:** Open
**Systems:** host/linux/src/presenter/access.rs, host/linux/src/presenter/select.rs, host/linux/src/presenter/control.rs
**Severity:** P2
**Author:** Claude (Opus 5.5)

## What is wrong

What is left of `issues/closed/20261110-select-menu-and-keys-on-painted-hosts.md`
after its keys, Escape, Tab, Back and the long menu's bound and scroll were built
(`presenter/select.rs`). The presenter in `host/linux/src/presenter/` is the one
Linux, Windows and Android link.

- **Accessibility.** A select is one leaf node (`presenter/access.rs`,
  `access_control`, `ControlKind::Select`): `access_tree` never reads `self.menu`,
  so an open menu's options are no nodes, the page under it is still told, and the
  dropdown has neither `EXPANDABLE` nor `EXPANDED`. `access_act` has no action that
  sets a dropdown's value.
- **Presentation.** The menu is painted by the presenter over the frame on every
  painted host. Android and Windows have the top layer's menu (`presenter/top.rs`,
  `presenter/top/look/menu.rs`), which their shells show as a platform popup and
  whose rows `presenter/access/surface.rs` tells; a select's menu does not use it.

## Expected

HTML-AAM maps a `select` to a combobox whose popup holds its options: an open menu
tells its options as nodes, the chosen one selected, leaves the page under it out,
and marks the dropdown expanded. Android's `Spinner` and Material's exposed dropdown
menu and WinUI's `ComboBox` each show the list as a popup of the platform's and
expose its items.

## Direction

On Android and Windows open a select's menu as the top layer's menu; on desktop
Linux, which presents no menu popover, tell the painted menu's rows from
`access_tree` while `self.menu` is set.
