# A clipped captureScreenshot never replies if the frame goes away

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** Automation keeps each capture's reply beside its evaluations and ends it with NotFoundError when the frame ends, and the viewport callback answers NotFoundError when the frame or its web view is gone.
**Systems:** host/apple

## What is wrong

`captureScreenshot` with a clip waits on `evaluateJavaScript` for the visual viewport, then returns without calling `answer` when the capture has been invalidated or the web view is gone. The reply closure lives only in that callback. `FrameAutomation.end` answers in-flight evaluations and `performActions`. It does not answer a capture.

Unmount, or a partition change, can happen while a dialog holds that script. The caller keeps the call until the callback. There is no timeout.

## Where

`host/apple/webarm/FrameCapture.swift`, the clip's `evaluateJavaScript` completion. `host/apple/webarm/FrameAutomation.swift`, `end` and the `captureScreenshot` arm of `run`.

## How to reproduce

Drive `captureScreenshot` with a clip. Invalidate the frame before the viewport script returns (unmount the frame, or swap its partition). The call does not answer.

## Direction

Register the capture reply beside the evaluations. Complete it from `end`, and from the early return in the viewport callback, with `NotFoundError`.
