# Windows Desk opens below its DPI-scaled minimum

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** Windows Desk opens at its design size scaled by its monitor's DPI and both that size and its minimum are bounded by the monitor's work area, the window moved into it.
**Systems:** apps/windows-desk
**Severity:** P2

## What is wrong

`CreateWindowExW` uses a fixed 1040 by 860 physical pixels. After per-monitor v2 awareness, `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` scales the minimum track size by `GetDpiForWindow / 96` from 760 by 710. Above about 125% the window is created smaller than its own minimum. Windows applies that minimum when the person resizes, not at creation.

At 150% the minimum is 1140 by 1065. On a 1080p work area that height does not fit, so the controls that landed outside the client cannot be resized into view.

## Where

`apps/windows-desk/src/native.rs`: `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` scales `ptMinTrackSize`; `CreateWindowExW` passes 1040 and 860.

## How to reproduce

Launch Windows Desk at 150% DPI on a 1080p display. The window is shorter than the minimum it will later enforce, and the lower controls sit outside the client.

## Direction

Scale the initial width and height by the monitor DPI the same way the minimum is scaled, and choose a minimum the work area can show.
