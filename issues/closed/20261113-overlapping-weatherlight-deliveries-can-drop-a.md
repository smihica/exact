# Overlapping Weatherlight deliveries can drop a counted tip

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** One delivery runs at a time: a delivery asked for while one runs only reads the count, and the running one reads the queue again before it finishes, so every write comes from one snapshot that holds every token counted.

## What is wrong

`deliverPurchases` reads `tips.json`, then for each purchased tip increments the count, writes the file, and consumes the purchase. The delivering task sends that answer again whenever `due` changes, and `due` changes when a consume updates the queue. A second call can read the file before the first write is issued.

Both calls then write their own snapshot. The later write replaces the file. A tip the first call already consumed is not in the second snapshot and is not offered again, so its count is gone. `readJson` refuses to invent a count over a failed read. Two successful reads of the same bytes are not serialized.

## Where

- `apps/weatherlight/app.ts` `deliverPurchases`
- `apps/weatherlight/app.contract` `deliver` and `task delivering when due != ""`

## How to reproduce

Leave two purchased `tip.small` entries in the unfinished queue and let the task fire a second `deliverPurchases` while the first is still in its loop (the first consume changes `due`). The file's `tips` value is short of the number of tokens consumed.

## Direction

Run one delivery at a time. Read the file again after each write, or ignore a `due` change until the in-flight answer has finished, and write a snapshot that still contains every token already consumed.
