# A disclosure chevron inside an if leaves the row link-coloured

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** A grouped link whose last shown child is an if showing the disclosure chevron (each branch the chevron or nothing) is now recoloured to the label, as one whose last child is the chevron itself.
**Systems:** contract lower, grouped rows

## What is wrong

A link that ends in a disclosure chevron is recoloured to the label, because that row pushes rather than navigating as a link. The test looks at the last shown child and asks whether that node itself is the chevron symbol. A last child that is `if` … the chevron does not match, so the link never receives `color` and stays `LinkText`.

The chevron's own ink is still the tertiary disclosure colour, because the walk does enter `if`. An optional disclosure (`if canOpen` then the symbol) draws link-coloured text beside a grey chevron. The comment on the function says a link that ends in a disclosure is the label's colour on every host.

## Where

`contract/lower/src/grouped/actions.rs` `disclosure`: the `tag == "link"` arm calls `chevron` on the last shown child. `chevron` matches a disclosure symbol, not an `if` whose shown arm is that symbol.

## How to reproduce

A grouped `link` whose last child is `if canOpen` containing `image "symbol:chevron.right"`. The title is link-coloured. The same chevron as a direct child is the label colour.

## Direction

Treat the last shown child as a disclosure when it is the chevron, or an `if` whose shown arms are that one symbol, the same way the leading-symbol check reads arms.
