# A replaced Android activity is not told its orientation lock

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** A reader made again forgets the orientation lock it was told and the epoch it was read at, as it forgets the wake lock, so the next tell sends the lock to the new activity.
**Systems:** host/android, host/linux

## What is wrong

A reader made again is supposed to be told the orientation lock anew. `requests_reset` clears Back, the keyboard, the wake lock, and pad input so the next tell sends them. It leaves `orientation` and `orientation_epoch` set.

`orientation_moved` returns nothing while the kernel epoch still matches, and after a later epoch only when the session differs from that cache. The new Android activity starts at the manifest orientation. A landscape or current lock stays wrong until the lock value itself changes.

## Where

`host/linux/src/presenter/requests.rs`, `requests_reset` and `orientation_moved`. `host/linux/src/presenter/device.rs`, `reader_replaced`. `host/android/canvas/src/main/java/dev/exact/canvas/Orientation.kt`, the comment that the lock is told anew to a reader made again.

## How to reproduce

Lock orientation to landscape or current, then recreate the activity (rotate a configuration this activity does not declare, or any replacement that keeps the process). The new activity uses the manifest orientation. `state.orientationlock` still shows the lock. The activity is not asked again.

## Direction

In `requests_reset`, clear `orientation` and `orientation_epoch`, as the wake lock is cleared, so the next tell queues the lock even when the session is unchanged.
