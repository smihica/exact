# Cancel during camera open leaves the photo session running

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** show stops a stream that arrives after the camera route is gone instead of holding it, and flip changes facing only in the then of its own applyConstraints, from the facing the track reports.
**Systems:** apps/photo-editor
**Severity:** P2

## What is wrong

`takePicture` pushes the camera sheet and sends `getUserMedia` without waiting. `track` is assigned only in `show`, which runs when that send settles. `cancel` calls `stopTrack` on `track` immediately. A cancel during open stops `""`, and the later `show` still stores the stream, so `holding` becomes true and the camera stays on after the sheet is gone.

`flip` writes `facing` in the same turn as `applyConstraints`, including when that call fails and including `NotFoundError` while `track` is still empty. The open uses the facing from the original send. Later flips target the other camera.

## Where

`apps/photo-editor/app.contract`, `takePicture`, `show`, `cancel`, and `flip`.

## How to reproduce

Take a photo and cancel before the stream arrives. The camera indicator stays on. Flip before the stream arrives, or while `applyConstraints` fails: the stored facing and the open camera disagree.

## Direction

Ignore `show` when the sheet is already gone, and stop the track it just received. Change `facing` only after `applyConstraints` succeeds.
