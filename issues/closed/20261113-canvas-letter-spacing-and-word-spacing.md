# Canvas letter spacing and word spacing stay at the font size from when they were set

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** Both recorders keep a spacing as written plus px and em parts, and resolve em, ex and ch (half an em) against the font in force when text is measured or its Font record is sent.

## What is wrong

`letterSpacing` and `wordSpacing` store a pixel length computed when the attribute is set. `em` is multiplied by the font size at that moment. `ex` and `ch` go through `length_px`, which resolves them against `BASE_SIZE` (10px), so they ignore the current font entirely. `set_font` replaces the font and does not recompute either spacing. `measure_raw` and `send_font` then record the stored pixels. The getter still returns the specified string, so the attribute reads `1em` while drawing uses the old gap.

The canvas text tests require the used value to follow a later font. `2d.text.drawing.style.letterSpacing.change.font` sets `letterSpacing` to `1em` at the default 10px font, then sets `font` to `20px serif` without touching the spacing, and expects the extra width to double. Both recorders (Rust and `canvas/recorder.js`) disagree with that, and they agree with each other, so every host paints the frozen gap.

## Where

- `canvas/src/context/text.rs` `spacing`, `set_letter_spacing`, `set_word_spacing`, `set_font`
- `canvas/src/font.rs` `length_px` (`ex` and `ch` against `BASE_SIZE`)
- `canvas/recorder.js`, the same pair of setters

## How to reproduce

On a 2D context: `letterSpacing = "1em"`, measure `"Hello World"`, then `font = "20px serif"` and measure again. The second measure should add twice the extra width. It adds the same width as the first.

## Direction

Keep the specified string and resolve `em`, `ex`, and `ch` from the font in force inside `measure_raw` and `send_font`, and in the JS recorder's twins.
