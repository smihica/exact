# The list-detail pattern keeps a failed write in its cache

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** The starter's `save` replaces its cache only after `atomicWriteFile` succeeds, and its mutations run one at a time, each on what the one before it saved.

## Problem

`save` replaces the module's `items` cache before awaiting `atomicWriteFile`
(`app.ts:13–17`). If storage refuses the write, the mutation fails but subsequent
reads and mutations use the unsaved items. A failed add then prevents its own
retry: `addItem` finds the cached title and returns the duplicate-title refusal.
That completed reply refreshes the list, showing the item even though storage
never accepted it. Relaunching loses it.

Failed removes and lock changes likewise leave the cache ahead of storage. An
unrelated successful mutation can later persist those previously failed changes.
Apps copied from this starter inherit the behavior.

## Reproduction

Verified at `f6be99af` by importing the actual data module with controlled storage:

1. Begin with an empty `items.json` and make its next atomic write throw `ENOSPC`.
2. Call `addItem("Alpha", "notes")`: it rejects with `ENOSPC`.
3. Restore successful writes and repeat the call: it returns `ok: false` with
   “There’s already an item called Alpha.”
4. Call `loadItems`: it returns Alpha, while the stored array is still empty.

## Fix

Publish the new cache only after the write succeeds. Serialize mutations that
share the cache so a concurrent mutation cannot read an intermediate version or
overwrite a successful one. Cover failed writes followed by retry and reload.

cache and does not fix this starter.
