# clock until can put a password's revealed value in its error

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** `clock until state` says only what a masked read gives: a revealed read names a missing field's enclosing value by kind, and a value the masked read cannot give is said to be unreadable, never taken revealed.

At `f6be99af`, `untilClock` deliberately compares revealed state and then
reads masked state for reporting. Two error paths bypass that separation:

- If the final masked read rejects or no longer contains the requested
  field, line 98 keeps the earlier revealed value. The failure message at
  lines 100–104 prints it.
- A missing nested field is formatted during the revealed read at line 72.
  That diagnostic includes the enclosing value. Since it has no `value`
  property, it never takes the masked-read branch.

A failed drive can therefore put a password into console output or a saved
test log, even though the command never requested revealed output. A typo
such as `password.length` is enough for the second path. The code's stated
contract is that password text is compared revealed and reported masked.

Reproduced by importing the actual `untilClock` on Bun 1.4.2 with a
controlled session. Its revealed state contains only the synthetic value
`synthetic-password-value`; its masked state contains bullets. No real
credentials or app storage were used:

```text
masked-read-fails: password was "synthetic-password-value"
missing-field: password has no field "length" (it is "synthetic-password-value")
```

The first case makes the masked read throw a controlled transport error.
The second uses `until state password.length == "other" within 10` and a
working masked reader. The full executable probe is
`/tmp/exact-review-20261112/until-clock-masking.mjs`.

Keep raw comparison values out of diagnostic objects. Format missing-field
errors from masked data, or describe only the path and type. If masked data
cannot be read, report that the value is unavailable; never fall back to
revealed data. Cover failed masked reads, fields removed between reads and
invalid nested paths through password strings and enclosing records.
