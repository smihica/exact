# The iOS software keyboard drops a textarea's Enter and Backspace

**Status:** Closed
**Resolution:** TextArea dispatches the software keyboard's Return (an unmarked newline in insertText) and Backspace (deleteBackward) as key events first and skips the edit when one is prevented, unless pressesBegan already delivered that hardware key (heard).

## What is wrong

A hardware key in an iOS textarea reaches `key` handlers in `pressesBegan`, before UIKit edits with it. The software keyboard does not. It calls `insertText` and `deleteBackward` directly. Those overrides edit the text and never call `keyDown`.

`TextField` does. Its `deleteBackward` calls `keyDown("Backspace")` unless `pressesBegan` already did, and `textFieldShouldReturn` does the same for Enter. A prevented key does not change the field. A textarea has no such call, so a handler for Enter or Backspace runs from a hardware keyboard and not from the software one. `preventDefault` cannot stop the software keyboard's newline or deletion.

The comment on this file says the software keyboard's Backspace and Return are keys the handlers hear.

## Where

`host/apple/Sources/ExactKit/IOS/TextAreaIOS.swift`, `TextArea.insertText`, `TextArea.deleteBackward`, and `TextArea.pressesBegan`. `TextField.deleteBackward` and `NodeView.textFieldShouldReturn` in `NodeViewIOS.swift` are the field path.

## How to reproduce

On an iPhone, focus a textarea whose `key` handler calls `preventDefault` for Enter or Backspace. Type Return or delete with the software keyboard. The handler does not run, and the text changes. The same keys on a hardware keyboard run the handler and leave the text alone.

## Direction

Give `TextArea` the `heard` guard `TextField` uses. In `insertText`, when the insertion is a newline and no composition is marked, call `keyDown("Enter")` first and skip the insertion when it returns true. In `deleteBackward`, call `keyDown("Backspace")` first and skip the deletion when it returns true. Skip the call when `pressesBegan` already delivered that key.
