// Which of a game's baked texture files a native bundle holds (LLP 1046.003,
// "Compressed textures"). The baker writes each texture as `x.tex` (RGBA8),
// `x.bc.tex` and `x.astc.tex`, and a device reads one of them
// (`game/render/src/surface/textures.rs`, `family`). Where every device of a
// platform reads one compressed family, its bundle holds that family alone:
// Metal on every Mac reads BC; every iPhone, iPad and Apple TV GPU (Apple2 and
// later) and the iOS simulator's read ASTC, which an M-series iPad reads too
// though it also reads BC. `TextureFamily::BUNDLED` (`game/engine/src/asset.rs`)
// is the renderer's side of this table. Other platforms hold every family.
//
// The bake decides (`bake/src/receipt.rs`): a roster it thinned names the family
// it kept in the cohort's inputs (`textureFamily`), and the bundle, a deploy's
// stream and a push's update thin by that family alone. An installed binary
// baked before thinning names none, and its renderer, which falls back to the
// RGBA8 file, is sent every file.
